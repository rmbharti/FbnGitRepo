If you're using a Marathon .deb package, it'll be logging to syslog - you can see the output by:
tail -f /var/log/syslog

Marathon log file location - /var/log/upstart



Otherwise, Marathon logs to sysout by default when running ./bin/start, so you'll need to pipe it into a logger application or specify your own log4j configuration file.

 am trying to change a few environment variables to pass to the marathon run script. According to the docs I should be able to create a file under /etc/default/marathon with vars like this

MARATHON_APP_MASTER=zk://localhost:2181/mesos
MARATHON_APP_ZK_HOST=zk://localhost:2181/mesos
MARATHON_APP_HTTP_PORT=8070
MARATHON_APP_WEBUI_URL=http://localhost:8070/index.html
and they should be parsed and turned into run cmds according to the bin script.

This does not happen when I start the service. The http port is still at 8080 and the interface has not changed.

I also tried to create my own upstart config with the following file at /etc/init/marathon

description "marathon"

start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]

export MY_IP=10.0.2.15
export ZK_HOST=`cat /etc/mesos/zk`

exec /usr/bin/marathon \
 --master $ZK_HOST \
 --zk $ZK_HOST \
 --hostname $MY_IP \
 --http_port 8070 \
 --webui_url http://$MY_IP:8070/index.html \
 --logging_level info```
This works for a few seconds and then I get the following errors in syslog


I think that you need a "run_jar" argument after the marathon command.

description "marathon"

start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]

export MY_IP=10.0.2.15
export ZK_HOST=`cat /etc/mesos/zk`

exec /usr/bin/marathon \
 run_jar \
 --master $ZK_HOST \
 --zk $ZK_HOST \
 --hostname $MY_IP \
 --http_port 8070 \
 --webui_url http://$MY_IP:8070/index.html \
 --logging_level info```

@kolloch The service unfortunately still is not staying up with that format. In /var/log/upstart/marathon.log
