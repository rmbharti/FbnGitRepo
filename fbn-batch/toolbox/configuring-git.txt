You don't need to do this from scratch, just use the Gitlab Virtualbox image that is provided.

Reference https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/wiki/VirtualBox-Image.

Download the Virtualbox image which can be found at http://minus.com/m55CpmY6C/.

Access virtual machine with vagrant:

vagrant box add gitlab /path/to/the/GITLAB-UBUNTU-SERVER-10.04-I386.box
vagrant init gitlab
vagrant up
In the vagrant file:

Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "gitlab"
  config.vm.network :hostonly, "33.33.33.10"
end
To login to vagrant:

vagrant ssh
To restart and upgrade the Gitlab Web Server:

cp gitlabhq/config/gitlab.yml{.example,}
cp gitlabhq/config/database.yml{.example,}
./restart_and_upgarde_gitlabhq
That starts the Gitlab server, and you can login to the Gitlab website at http://33.33.33.10

A GitLab admin login is already set up with username "admin@local.host", and password "5iveL!fe".


$ sudo yum install <packagename>
However, when trying to install git this way, you'll encounter the following error on CentOS 5:

$ sudo yum install git
Setting up Install Process
Parsing package install arguments
No package git available.
Nothing to do
This tells you that the package repositories that yum knows about don't contain the required rpms (RPM Package Manager files) to install git. This is presumably because CentOS 5 is based on RHEL 5, which was released in 2007, before git was considered a mature version control system. To get around this problem, we need to add additional repositories to the list that yum uses (We're going to add the RPMforge repository, as per these instructions).

This assumes you want the i386 packages. Test by running uname -i. If you want the x86_64 packages, replace all occurrences of i386 with x86_64 in the following commands

First, download the rpmforge-release package:

$ wget http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
Next, verify and install the package:

$ sudo rpm --import http://apt.sw.be/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt
$ rpm -K rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
$ sudo rpm -i rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
And now we should be able to install git:

$ sudo yum install git-gui
yum will work out the dependencies, and ask you at relevant points if you want to proceed. Press y for Yes, and n or return for No.

It looks like packages.sw.be is now dead. Its timing out. – jww Jan 26 at 12:35

Are you using a Debian-related distro? If not, you may need to use a different package manager, like YUM (nowadays Red Hat, CentOS, etc.), Portage, Entropy, RPM, etc.

When using a Debian-related distro:

What does it give you?

$ command -V apt-get
apt-get is /usr/bin/apt-get
Is the binary really there?

$ file /usr/bin/apt-get
